== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I find the colors in my post? =

Short: In the custom fields area.

WordPress has the ability to allow post authors to assign custom fields to a post. This extra information is known as meta-data. You will find your image swatches right there.

If you don't see the custom fields widget at all you have to enable it for that particular post or page. Go to the "Screen Options" button at the top of your page and check the Custom Fields box.

= Why are there no colors in my post? =

Short: Update your post (again).

The color palette for a post is generated the moment you save a post or page. So you have to save a post at least once, after the Plugin was activated.

A functionality for a bulk update is already on the roadmap.
